4. (50 points +5 bonus points) Download the file "trans.txt", where every line is a transactionrepresented by a set of item ids.
(1) Implement the Apriori algorithm to find all frequent patterns under different settings of theminimum frequency (minimum support/#transactions). Vary the minimum frequency
minFreq as0.0001, 0.0002, 0.0003, 0.0004 and 0.0005. Report the number of frequent patterns, as well as the number of size-frequent patterns for each size with at least one frequent pattern, under eachsetting of
minFreq. (35 points)
(2) Try to optimize your algorithm using acceleration techniques. Explain each specific accelerationyou adopt by providing a running time comparison between adopting the acceleration and notadopting the acceleration. (10 points)
(3) You also need to submit your code. You can use whatever programming languages you like.Please provide a readme file describing how to run your code. (5 points)
(4) Try to make your algorithm finish computing for the task in (1) within 5 mins. The TA will run yourcode to check your algorithm's running time.
